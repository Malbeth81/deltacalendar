DeltaCalendar will display a small calendar on your desktop. The appearance of the calendar
is completely customizable, you can change the fonts, colors, sizes, effects, borders and margins
for each of it's zones. You can also choose on which day the calendar's week starts and also
if you wish week numbers and week days to be displayed or not. The calendar can also show you
future or past month by using the inovative calendar control bar to quickly navigate thru them.

You can also add memos to a specific day on the calendar, a memo can be of single, weekly, monthly
or yearly type. A day with a memo will de displayed differently on the calendar and the text
of the memo will show when your mouse cursor moves over that day and also in the "Memo of the day"
zone below the calendar..

By default, when you install the calendar, it's background color is set to transparent but
total transparency will only work in Windows 2000 and XP. If the calendar shows a pink background,
you must set the back value to solid in the configuration.
